				At my past job at a digital agency I transformed Photoshop, Sketch, and InVision designs into functioning
				websites. But the designs gave no instructions on how to handle the in-between resolutions.{' '}
				<span aria-hidden="true">‚òπÔ∏è</span> So, to minimize the abrupt layout jumps I employed a technique I call
				responsify, which uses CSS <Code>calc()</Code> function to <em>fluidly</em> change <Code>width</Code>,{' '}
				<Code>margin</Code>, <Code>left</Code>, etc. so they match the value at the neighboring breakpoint.

				alone. Many told me it didn't click for them until they saw it in action. <span aria-hidden="true">üí°</span>{' '}
				So, below's a screen recording of an example.
