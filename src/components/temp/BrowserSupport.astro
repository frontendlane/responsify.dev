		>Browser support is very good. In spite of IE having <Link href="https://caniuse.com/calc/">
			known issues with <Code>calc()</Code>
		</Link> I haven't encountered any. Two of the examples use <Code>clamp()</Code> and
		<Code>min()</Code>, which IE doesn't support. As far as "exotic" üê† CSS values go: <Code>vw</Code>
		is supported by all browsers and <Code>ch</Code> is narrower on IE compared to other browsers, so just look out for that.</p
